This module contains methods/functions for beamforming. The raw 1D correlatoins and weights are read 
in using the passed in paths. The correlations are sorted into 3D matrices (elemXelemXintegrations). 
The beamforming weights are then applied to each plane of this 3D array. The resulting array is passed back
to PAF_Filler.py to sort the frequency channels and collate metadata. The method that drives the beamforming, 
getSpectralArray(), is called from PAF_Filler.py.

Inputs from PAF_Filler.py for task getSpectralArray:
fitsName - The scan name (i.e. time stamp) that is currently being processed
data - correlation matrices in the form of integrationsx(corrs * numFreqs)
beam - beam currently being processed
xID - xID of BANK being processed
